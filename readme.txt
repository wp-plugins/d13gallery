= How do I add a gallery to a post? =

You have a Wordpress blog installed at "http://www.yourblog.com/blog" and you want to create a gallery of your wedding photos and attach them to the post "Look! We're married...".

The first step, as stated above, is to upload the images that you want to include in your gallery. To keep all of your galleries tidy, you may want to create a folder called "galleries" to hold all of your d13Gallery files - this would be created at "http://www.yourblog.com/blog/galleries". Within that folder you'd create a new folder just to hold your wedding photos "http://www.yourblog.com/blog/galleries/wedding". You're then ready to upload all of your image files (GIF, JPG or PNG) to this new folder.

Now that your images are uploaded you can create a link to your gallery within a post. Use the Wordpress admin pages to edit or create a post and start typing. When you get to the place in your post where you'd like to add a gallery just use the following text:

{gallery}location/of/images{/gallery}

In the example this text would be:

{gallery}galleries/wedding{/gallery}

Save or publish your post and then view your blog - your new image gallery will be embedded within your new post.
